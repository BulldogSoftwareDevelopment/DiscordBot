# DiscordBot

Bulldog Software Development's Discord bot project.

# Prerequisites

- [Java - Version 8 >](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

# Setup

1. Clone the repository by opening your terminal of choice and then run `git clone https://github.com/BulldogSoftwareDevelopment/DiscordBot`.

2. Simply open the folder in your IDE of choice!

3. Install this project's dependencies. Navigate back into your terminal of choice and navigate into it by running `cd DiscordBot`. Once you are in the folder, simply run `mvn dependency:resolve
`.

4. Once all is said and done, you will need a token. To find out how to create a bot account and access its token, please follow the instructions listed [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html).

5. Modify the `token` variable in the [App.java](https://github.com/BulldogSoftwareDevelopment/DiscordBot/blob/master/src/main/java/App.java) file to include your bot's token.

6. Let's get this thing up and running! Once you have your bot's token saved, simply run the main function in `App.java` and you should see some output!

If you have any questions regarding this process or need any help, feel free to ping one of us in the Discord server!
